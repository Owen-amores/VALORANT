			<h3>Pheonix Tips and Tricks</h3>
			<li>Be aggressive - Pheonix is the perfect entry-fragger, blind your opponents, get in their face and get the kills.</li>
			<li>Blaze is like a super Molotov, not only will it damage enemies it will heal you. Use it, push them back and go in for the kill.</li>
			<li>Run it back is good when playing as the entry fragger or when pushing into a Spike site - but be careful be far back enough that when you respawn you are not quickly moped up by the opponent who has killed your replica.</li>
